## 🔍 Workflow Overview

### 1️⃣ Data Audit & Cleaning 
-  Removed duplicates and handled missing values
-  Verified data types and feature distributions
-  Ensured data integrity before modeling

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
-  Visualized feature distributions and relationships
-  Identified outliers, trends, and potential target leakage
-  Explored correlations to guide feature selection

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering  
Created new features to enrich the dataset:
-  `TotalRooms` = sum of bedrooms, bathrooms, and living areas
-  `Density` = rooms per land size  
- Validated feature impact using correlation heatmaps and scatter plots

### 4️⃣ Encoding & Scaling 
-  Applied One-Hot Encoding for nominal features
-  Used Target Encoding for high-cardinality categoricals
-  Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler for model stability

### 5️⃣ Modeling & Evaluation  
Trained and compared multiple regression models:

| Model                   | R² Score | MSE         |
|------------------------|----------|-------------|
| Linear Regression       | 0.72     | 1,800,000   |
| Random Forest Regressor | 0.83     | 1,200,000   |
| XGBoost Regressor       | 0.86 ✅  |   980,000   |

- Best performance: **XGBoost** with R² = 0.86  
- Metrics used: R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### 6️⃣ Reproducibility & Organization 
- Saved processed datasets and trained models
- Structured project folders for clarity and reuse
- Documented every step in Arabic and English for accessibility
